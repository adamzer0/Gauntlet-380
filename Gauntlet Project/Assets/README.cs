     * To start press 1 (Warrior), 2 (Valk) 3 (Wizard) or 4 (Elf) 
     * More players are also spawned by pressing these buttons
     * If a class has died it cannot be respawned.
     * If all spawned player are killed its game over!
     * Get to the goal to get to the next level (Green square)
     * 
     * food is for healing (looks like a drumstick)... Dont shoot it.
     * Gold is for score (Golden sphere)
     * Bombs deal damage to everything on screen. If you shoot one, it activates automatically
     * at a weaker level.
     * Keys look like small yellow pills.
     * 
     * Doors are white squares, open them with a key.
     * 
     * Controls:
     * 
     * Warrior
     * Valk

     * Elf
     * 
     * 
     * To start the game, start at level 0. No other level will work.
